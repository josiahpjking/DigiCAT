Home Counterfactual Analysis,Counterfactual Analysis,Anailís Frithfhíorasach
Home CA description,"The aim of counterfactual analysis is to estimate the causal effects of interventions or treatments, by comparing what actually happened (observed outcomes) with what would have happened if a different action had been taken (counterfactual outcomes). In observational settings, where random allocation into different treatments is not possible, researchers often employ methods involving 'propensity scores' (the estimated probability of receiving the treatment/intervention, based on a set of observed covariates). These propensity scores can then be used in an analysis to balance the characteristics of treatment vs non-treated groups, reducing bias and enabling a more accurate estimation of the causal effect of receiving the treatment. For more info, visit our tutorial.","Is é aidhm na hanailíse frithfhíorasach ná éifeachtaí cúiseacha idirghabhálacha nó cóireálacha a mheas, trí chomparáid a dhéanamh idir an méid a tharla i ndáiríre (torthaí breathnaithe) agus an méid a tharlódh dá ndéanfaí gníomh difriúil (torthaí frithfhíorasacha). I suíomhanna breathnadóireachta, nuair nach féidir leithdháileadh randamach a dhéanamh ar chóireálacha éagsúla, is minic a úsáideann taighdeoirí modhanna a bhaineann le ‘scóir claonadh’ (an dóchúlacht mheasta go bhfaighfear an chóireáil/idirghabháil, bunaithe ar thacar de chomhathraitheanna breathnaithe). Is féidir na scóir claonadh seo a úsáid ansin in anailís chun tréithe na cóireála vs grúpaí neamhchóireáilte a chothromú, ag laghdú laofachta agus ag cumasú meastachán níos cruinne ar éifeacht chúise na cóireála.

Approach Binary description,"The aim of counterfactual analysis is to estimate the causal effects of 'exposures' or 'treatments' by comparing what actually happened (observed outcomes) with what would have happened if a different action had been taken (counterfactual outcomes). Because we can never directly observe counterfactual outcomes, we compare groups who differ in their treatment. However, in observational settings where random allocation into different treatments is not possible, researchers may employ methods that such as 'matching' or 'weighting' of participants to ensure that the different treatment groups being compared are 'balanced' with respect to other characteristics.",Approach Binary description
Approach PSM description,You've chosen propensity matching. This approach involves creating balanced comparison groups by matching treated individuals with similar untreated individuals based on their propensity scores (probability of someone having a specific treatment based on a set of ‘matching variables’). This aims to ensure that the groups are comparable in terms of potential confounding variables. The treatment effect is then estimated by comparing outcomes between the matched groups. ,Approach PSM description

Approach PSM link, See the ‘propensity matching’ section of the tutorials for more information.,Approach PSM link
Approach IPTW description,"You’ve chosen IPTW. IPTW aims to rebalance treated and untreated individuals using a weighted regression approach. It first estimates propensity scores (probability of someone having a specific treatment based on a set of ‘matching variables’. It then transforms these into weights that are used in a regression model to up-weight (i.e., give more importance to) untreated and treated cases that are similar in terms of their propensity scores and down-weight cases that are very different. This helps to rebalance the treated and untreated groups.",Approach IPTW description
Approach IPTW link,See the ‘IPTW’ section of the tutorials for more information.,Approach IPTW link
Approach NBP description,"As you have an ordinal treatment variable (i.e., an ordered categorical treatment variable) an appropriate counterfactual analysis approach is non-bipartite propensity matching (NBP). NBP finds pairs of people who differ in their treatment dosage but who have similar treatment propensities based on their matching variables and compares their outcome variable levels. As the treatment is ordinal, this might involve matching and comparing people with for example, low with medium treatment doses and medium with high doses.",Approach NBP description

Approach Missingness tutorial link,"For more information on missingness, see the ‘missing data’ section of the tutorials.",Approach Missingness tutorial link
Approach MI description,"The fundamental idea behind multiple imputation is to create several (M) completed datasets by predicting what the missing values would have been if we could observe them. These datasets are then analysed separately, and the results of each of these datasets are combined, or ‘pooled’, together. The variability across datasets allows the standard errors to take account of the uncertainty due to the fact that some of the data are predicted rather than observed. DigiCAT imputes 5 complete datasets, conducts the analysis in each and then combines the results across them. However, don’t forget that this statistical method relies on assumptions, which can be difficult to test. If these assumptions are violated, your inferences may be invalid. Multiple imputation assumes ‘missingness at random’ (MAR) meaning that the missingness depends on the data you have available in your model but not on the unobserved values of the outcome variable.",Approach MI description
Approach MI tutorial link,Please see our tutorial pages on multiple imputation for a detailed discussion.,Approach MI tutorial link
Approach CC description,"Complete case analysis (CCA) (also sometimes known as ‘listwise deletion’), will only analyse the completely observed cases. This analysis will allow valid inferences of your data if the missing data are missing completely at random (MCAR), because the observed values will be a random sample of the complete dataset. If the data are missing at random (MAR) which means that the missingness can be predicted from the data available or missing not at random (MNAR), the inferences may be invalid.",Approach CC description
Approach CC tutorial link,Please see our tutorial pages for a detailed discussion of complete case analysis.,Approach CC tutorial link
Approach Weighting description,Non-response weighting deals with missingness by up-weighting cases that have a low probability of being observed in the sample and down-weighting variables that have a high probability of being observed in the sample. This is done using a weighted regression approach. These weights are often supplied with datasets and are selected at the ‘data upload’ stage of DigiCAT. ,Approach Weighting description

Balancing Matching method description IPTW,"In IPTW, the propensity scores estimated based on the set of matching variables are transformed to provide weights to be used in the outcome model. All the data are used (unlike in some methods where some cases might not achieve a match and be discarded). In DigiCAT the ATE is estimated which means that the weights used essentially down-weight treated cases with a high propensity score and up-weight control cases with a low propensity score. This ‘re-balances’ the treatment and control groups to make them more similar.",

Balancing NN description,"Nearest neighbour matching is used in counterfactual analysis as a method for pairing treated and control cases with similar propensity scores.

Then, from those left the remaining most similar treated and control cases are paired and so on and so forth until all viable matches have been made. ",Balancing NN description
Balancing NN tutorial link,See the nearest neighbour matching tutorial for more details.,Balancing NN tutorial link
Balancing Optimal ordinal description,"NBP uses a version of optimal matching to pair up cases who experienced different dosages of the treatment variable (e.g., high versus medium; medium versus low). Optimal matching is based on finding matches to minimise the overall propensity score differences between matched cases.

Balancing Matching ratio description,"Matching ratios in propensity score matching refer to the number of control/untreated individuals that are matched to each treated individual. In DigiCAT, matching ratios can be specified to control the trade-off between achieving better balance between treatment groups and maintaining a larger sample size.

Balancing 1tok ratio description,"You've chosen a 1:K matching ratio. By matching more than 1 control to each treated unit more of the sample can be used. However, this can come at the cost of the treated and untreated groups being less balanced and can mean there is more bias. Note that if you have a limited number of untreated participants you may not be able to implement a matching ratio greater than 1:1.",Balancing 1tok ratio description

Outcome LR description,"Linear regression is a way of modelling the associations between exploratory variable(s) and a continuous outcome variable. The model takes the form y = bX + e, where y and x are our outcome and explanatory variables respectively, and e is the random error. Of interest here is b, which is the estimated effect of our treatment variable on our outcome. By fitting a model to a sample that is either matched or weighted according to the propensity of treatment, we can better estimate the **causal** effect of the treatment on our outcome variable. As you select an outcome model option more information will appear.",

Outcome LR w covar interaction description,"This option will fit a linear regression with your chosen outcome and the following predictors: i) the treatment variable ii) all matching variables iii) all interactions between treatment and matching variables. This method addresses the fact that dependencies (or ‘clustering’) are introduced into the data due to matching and can help to deal with the effects of any remaining imbalance that isn’t completely addressed by the matching or weighting. It additionally deals with imbalance and bias that might be related to the fact that treatment status might interact with the matching variables (e.g., a treatment might affect people of different genders differently so if there isn’t a perfect gender balance there might be some bias in estimating the treatment effect).",Outcome LR w covar interaction description
